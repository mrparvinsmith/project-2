This will be a group work manager where users will organize projects and meetings about said projects.  
The MVP will allow users to create project task-lists, post comments, and view a calendar containing info about deadlines and meetings.  

Stretch goals:
*optional privacy for projects
*allowing tasks to be broken down into smaller tasks with their own subpages
